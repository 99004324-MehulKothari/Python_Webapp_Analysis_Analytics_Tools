## Challenges Faced and How was it overcome

1.	Overload of software which lead to overuse of request time- using CDN
2.	Not using pre-uri waf(web application firewall) which could lead to not giving admin access in app itself
3.	Rendering the analysis result in the same thread , solution - used pygal library.
4.	Data sharing â€“ using bulk share and sqlcmd.
